# ironclaw-diceroller
Discord bot to support playing Ironclaw.

This bot uses the JavaCord library to interact with Discord.  To get started with a new bot, you will first need to set it up in your account.  Follow the directions here:

https://javacord.org/wiki/getting-started/creating-a-bot-account.html#create-a-bot-and-get-its-token

There are more complete directions coming on how to install this fully but for now, this code can be pulled down and built easily into a working bot using Maven. Java 8 is required to build and run this.

Finally, this can be run using java -jar <filename>.  You will also be required to create an application.properties file that exists in the same directory as your jar file with a single line of serverToken=<token> which you will get from the JavaCord directions.
